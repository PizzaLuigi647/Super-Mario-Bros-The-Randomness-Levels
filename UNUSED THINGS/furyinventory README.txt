You'll need the following to make this work:

- modernReserveItems by KBM-Quine ( https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=26306 )

How to use:

Go to your luna.lua and put this in the file:

local furyinventory = require("furyinventory")

When saved, reload the level and it should work. If not, put modernReserveItems into the episode folder. If anything else happens, please contact me on Discord (Spencer Everly#1997), or on the forums.
